# NLP-Disaster-Tweets
This notebook builds a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not. The vectorization of text is done by GloVe Embeddings.

The [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started) dataset from Kaggle has been used.
